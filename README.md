# Signature-Verification-Using-Siamese-Network-in-Matlab
The project verify between two signatures using Siamese network with ResNet 101 as its base network. 

The repository has all the files needed 

Here I've use BHSig260 Dataset and can be downloaded from 
https://www.kaggle.com/poojababuraj/signature-datasets


Use folderimageresize.m file to resize the image by just changing the folderloc. and resize to 224 224 
 
Use signature_verification_using_Siamese.mlx(live script) file to train and test the files and metion the folder location in the file and its ready to go.
or even you can use res101sig_veri.m file as well(NON live script)

The average accuracy that I got is 72.40 %"
